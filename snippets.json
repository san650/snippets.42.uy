I don't want the command to be echoed on command line!… and there's more…I don't want it to be recursive so, if I'm saving another key mapping in the future and I write the sequence `,<space>` on the right hand side, it's not supposed to call `:nohlsearch` again, it's supposed to refer to the original behavior of the `,` then `<space>` keys."
